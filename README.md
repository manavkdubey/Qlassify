# Quantum-Enhanced Image Classifier

Welcome to the Quantum-Enhanced Image Classifier repository! This project represents an innovative approach to image classification by leveraging the principles of quantum computing within a classical neural network architecture.

## Overview

The repository houses a Jupyter notebook detailing a hybrid machine learning model that integrates a classical convolutional neural network, ResNet18, with a quantum circuit. This unique model is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned using quantum computing principles to potentially exceed the performance of traditional image classifiers.

## Quantum Machine Learning (QML)

Quantum Machine Learning is an exciting and emerging field that combines quantum physics with machine learning algorithms. The quantum circuit included in the model aims to take advantage of quantum entanglement and superposition to process information in ways that classical computers cannot.

## Repository Structure

The main components of this repository include:

- `qml_image.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the full code and explanation of the hybrid quantum-classical image classification model.
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the purpose and structure of the repository.

## Setup

To run the notebook, you will need to install several dependencies:

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- PennyLane
- Other common data science libraries

Install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision pennylane
```

## Usage

To use this classifier:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have Jupyter installed (`pip install jupyter` if not).
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `qml_image.ipynb`.
4. Execute the cells in the notebook to instantiate and run the model.
